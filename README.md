This is [Silverwind's](https://silverwind.store/) official website repository.

Version 3 of the site is in early stages of development.

### Changes

1. [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/) will be implement as the primary headless CMS. No more hard coded content _(hopefully)_.

1. [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) first.

1. [Mantine.dev](https://mantine.dev/) to be used when possible for component consistency.

1. Se separate [Firebase](https://firebase.com/) and [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/) dev & prod environments.

### Lessons learned

Things that I wish I implemented earlier.

1. A robust and consistent CI/CD pipeline makes all the difference.

1. Utilize branching more and separate dev/prod environments.

1. Abstract and refactor more than you initially may think.

1. Make stupid simple verbose functions.

1. Use Typescript.

1. [TDD](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development#:~:text=Test%2Ddriven%20development%20(TDD),software%20against%20all%20test%20cases.>).

1. [KID](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-documentation-matters-and-why-you-should-include-it-in-your-code-41ef62dd5c2f/).
